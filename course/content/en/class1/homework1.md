## Re-visit

Most depictions of addiction portray individuals at the far end of the spectrum, typically focusing on drug use--whether the emphasis is on crack, crystal meth, or heroin, the majority of the images we see show people living on the streets or in dirty depressing environments, with bad teeth and skin and vacant eyes. Even though we know that people can hold down jobs and hide a serious habit from their friends, colleagues, and families, that's not what we picture when we think about addiction. In reality, addiction (often referred to as a [substance use disorder](https://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/substance-use)) can be diagnosed long before someone's destructive behavior is obvious, and it can involve a variety of substances including marijuana and alcohol.

Having listened to the interviews and reflected on the subsequent discussions and feedback, you should revisit and amend your original 4Corners submission or submit an entirely new response that depicts addiction in one of these earlier stages, or in a way that goes beyond the typical images we see. Please provide critique and support to fellow participants.

By the time I found someone else to get heroin I was a real mess and just desperate to get straight again. I normally knew the strength of what I was using but in this instance I didn't really care as I was hurting too much from withdrawal. I remember setting up my little point and shoot digital camera (almost a habit at that point) then sitting on the edge of the couch as I shot up. The dope was so strong and hit me so hard I pretty much passed out immediately. It wasn't until days later that I came across the sequence of images and remembered what had happened. It's a constant danger with injecting heroin -- you never know the strength or what it could be cut with. I consider myself lucky not to have overdosed. This image is a snapshot of a specific moment in my addiction -- not a comprehensive view of how I was all the time. There were times in those years when it would have been hard to tell I was an addict and of course other times when it was much more obvious. Addicts don't always present themselves in the way we imagine.","author":"Graham Macindoe","publication":"","publicationUrl":"https://www.grahammacindoe.com/","date":""},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Graham Macindoe","year":"2009","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":""}}
