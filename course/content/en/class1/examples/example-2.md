This means the mentally ill are frequently ostracized, and regarded as a danger to society. Many end up in prison. South Sudan’s animist and Christian cultures treat mental illness with traditional cures or prayers, practices that many professionals see as insufficient or as sheer profiteering. Juba has only a handful of qualified psychiatrists and psychologists, but international NGOs are working with the Sudanese authorities to improve conditions for the mentally ill.","author":"Robin Hammond","publication":"NOOR for Handicap International","publicationUrl":"","date":"April 2, 2016"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Robin Hammond","year":"2016","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"Hellen Alfred (41) lives with a mental health condition, in Juba, South Sudan.
