  The World Press Photo Foundation Archive contains over sixty years of iconic images. We have selected some of the recent winners and reimagined them as Four Corners Images. It is an example of how 4C can be creatively adapted to add rich meta-date to historical images. Instead of the frames before and after, we have included contemporaneous and subject-related content and for the codes of ethics we have instead substituted the WPPF competition rules.
