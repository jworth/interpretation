title: About Four Corners
description: >-
  The information surrounding a photograph will change the way it is
  interpreted. Context creates meaning. <INSERT MEME EXAMPLE> Four Corners is an
  authoring tool for photographers. It enables the photographer to add extra
  information into an image so that they are no longer reliant on the
  surrounding information to convey their intended meaning. It is central to
  Interpretation because it enables the reader to interrogate the photograph and
  better understand the motivation, perspective and values of the photographer.

## Why Four Corners

Four Corners is simple way of presenting contextual information about a photograph. It enables the reader to see what is happening in the photograph, why the photographer made it and under what conditions.

> Ex-New York Times Photo Editor [Fred Ritchin], proposed the idea in his book `After Photography`. He envisaged each corner of an image providing access to extra information; top left would be the frames before and after, top right would be links to further, related information. Bottom left would be the background-story of the image and bottom right would be the photographer’s name, copyright terms and, their code of ethics.

**We’re using 4C because it shifts the role of the photographer from being suppliers of content to becoming publishers, and allows the reader to interrogate the photograph in a richer way.**
